            <div class="overview">
                I was the first designer to arrive on the project, in 2016, and was tasked with laying its conceptual foundations.
                I worked with the creative director as a scribe, facilitator and sparring partner, clarifying what the
                game's high-level experience, pillars, and primary systems should be. I then liaised with the project's technical and
                production directors to help define what we should be building and how.
            </div>
            <div class="overview">
                The process ended up vaguely resembling  the top-down <b>Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics (MDA)</b> framework, 
                but with all the twists, turns and dead ends that befit a creative, collaborative endeavour. 
                Ultimately I would create a number of <b>PowerPoint</b> presentations to help onboard the other designers when, 
                in 2017, they began to move onto the project from Endless Space 2. 
                This documentation was still relevant for onboarding when more designers were brought onto the team in 2021.

            <div class="subsubtitle">Prototyping</div>
            <div class="overview">
                I created prototypes for the game's cultural transition, cultural propagation, and tactical battle systems,
                all of which helped prove that our theories worked in practice. 
                They also served to onboard and inspire new team members as they arrived: 
                we notably used the tactical battle prototype to organise a studio-wide tournament, offering a bottle of champagne to the winner.  
            </div>
            <div class="overview">
                I used <b>PowerPoint</b> to create the cards and other assets for the paper prototype, but this made iteration difficult:
                I now tend to use <b>Nandeck</b> for these kinds of prototypes. 
                I wanted the battle prototype to be as frictionless as possible for other team members to access, 
                so I wrote it using <b>HTML</b> and <b>Javascript</b> for the client.
                The game was hosted on our network on a <b>Node.js</b> server using <b>Socket.io</b>.
                I still use HTML and Node.js to share prototypes, but tend to use <b>Godot</b> to create them.

            <div class="overview">
                When the bulk of the studio's design team arrived from Endless Space 2, 
                I took charge of the tactical battle, trade, diplomacy and cultural propagation systems specifically. 
                I notably ironed out what the game's 60 cultures and 128 military units should be, and
                how diplomatic grievances, wars, reinforcements, sieges, aerial battles, cruise missiles and amphibious assaults should work.
            </div>
            <div class="overview">
                I used <b>PowerPoint</b> to pitch various proposed iterations, discussing them with the creative director and lead designer until we reached a consensus.
                I then created and maintained technical specifications on <b>Confluence</b>, and used <b>Excel</b> for rational content design:
                power curves and other such techniques were used to provide guidance when tuning the numeric data.

            <div class="overview">
                During my time as senior designer on the project I helped mentor several juniors, delegating content and AI design tasks.
                I took over as lead game designer in 2020, and managed a team of 8 designers through the Covid pandemic to release.
                This includes 4 who joined the team during my tenure and who I needed to onboard and train remotely.
            </div>
            <div class="overview">
                The role required flexibility, patience, and tact, so I drew a lot on 
                <b>Non-violent Communication</b> and <b>Improvisational Theatre</b>.
                I tried to always delegate those tasks that were <i>most</i> in my area of expertise:
                this meant that I could provide clearer guidance and more detailed feedback, to help my people grow in the long run.
                It was a challenging time, but we released successfully and the feedback I received from my team was generally positive.
