            <div class="overview">
                Brought on for the final 16 months of development, I was able to help finalise the design of much of the game's content.
                I then took charge of tuning essentially every numeric value in the game, including the attributes and costs of military units, 
                power upgrades, relics, neutral places of power, artefacts, manuscripts, praetors, rituals, events and schemes. 
                I created and maintained a set of spreadsheets to keep track of all of this data for QA, and to run automated sanity checks on it.

            <div class="overview">
                I successfully pitched adding unique, active abilities as a way of strongly differentiating the 9 playable Archfiend characters.
                I then proposed designs for each of these abilities, iterating with the creative director and other designers 
                until we settled on something that we all felt was appropriate. 
                I also pitched, defended and wrote specifications for the streamlined praetor duelling system that ended up being implemented:
                this was tricky, as the new system needed to fit into our remaining budget while using the art that had been created for the original system.

            <div class="overview">
                I designed and helped implement the game's computer opponents, including their heuristic-based goal-selection,
                personality system (Archfiend-specific behaviour), and grievance-tracking in order to choose favoured opponent. 
                I hacked in the system for sending in-character messages to human players: 
                this required a light touch, as the player can easily feel that they being spammed if you're not careful.

            <div class="overview">
                As well as tuning content and NPC behaviour, I got my hands dirty directly implementing much of the dynamic content for the game's notification system.
                This included messages detailing the specific effects of any events and rituals that are resolved, 
                and messages explaining why specific players actions have failed.
                Given the asynchronous nature of the game, clear messaging in these areas was vital: I'm very proud of the result.
